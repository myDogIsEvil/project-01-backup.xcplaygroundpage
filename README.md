unit 01 project
The purpose of this project is to sort a group of soccer players into three evenly matched teams, based on their experience levels (exta 
credit if also sort based on avgerage height.  After the players info is entered into a collection storing their info (I chose to use an
array of dictionary), the players array are sorted into 2 new arrays of the same type based on experience.  Next the players are divided into 
3 teams, so that each team has the same number of players (which means they have the same number of expienced and inexperienced players).  
Lastly, a letter must be generated and printed to each players guardian welcoming them to that team.
